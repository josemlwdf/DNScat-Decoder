# DNScat-Decoder
TCP Stream Extractor from PCAP using Python

This Python script extracts TCP streams from a Packet Capture (PCAP) file by filtering DNS queries for a specified "bad" domain.
Overview

The script uses the tshark tool to read a PCAP file, extracting DNS query names, and filters packets based on a specified "bad" domain. It decodes relevant packet data and extracts TCP streams associated with the provided domain.
Prerequisites

`Python 3.x
tshark (Wireshark command-line tool)`

Installation

Before using the script, ensure that tshark is installed on your system. If not, the script provides instructions for installation based on the operating system.
Install tshark

Linux Install tshark using apt-get by running:

    sudo apt-get install -y tshark

Usage
Running the Script

To run the script, execute it from the command line:

`python dnscat_decoder.py path_to_pcap_file bad_domain`

`path_to_pcap_file: Path to the input PCAP file.`

`bad_domain: Domain used by dnscat. For example: "microsofto365.com"`

Example

    python3 dnscat_decoder.py sample.pcap "microsofto365.com"
